The .AI and .PDF files are going to be your main vector logos which can be scaled or down to any size without distortion. Your JPGs and PNGs are smaller files to view, those can be used to post on social or just to give someone as a preview since they are smaller files make sure you don't use those for any print pieces unless they need the logo to be small (on screen they should work just fine). Lastly PNGs have transparent backgrounds vs JPGs that have a solid background.
