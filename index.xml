&lt;p>Each BSides is a community-driven framework for building events for and by information security community members. The goal is to expand the spectrum of conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and time. It creates opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are happening.&lt;br>

&lt;h1 id="what-is-bsidesfortwayne">What is BSidesFortWayne?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>BSidesFortWayne started as a conversation amongst friends with the desire to see an information security conference right here in our city. &amp;ldquo;Better Together&amp;rdquo; is a theme for our local conference. When we connect with other information security professionals and share our knowledge openly, we can each better secure ourselves and the organizations that we help protect. We&amp;rsquo;re also extremely excited to see how this can open up new opportunities for organizations to find talent and for folks that are wanting to break into the information security industry to gain knowledge and make connections with people that may help propel them into the industry.&lt;/p>
